El documento maestro de requisitos esta en docs/requirements/PACMAN_MVS_ZOS_REQUISITOS_DESARROLLO_v4.docx. No releerlo completo en cada sesion;
consultar unicamente las secciones de la fase actual cuando CURRENT_PHASE.md lo indique (G5: sec. 25 fila G5 y sec. 26 MVS-G5).

MVS-G3 COMPLETE (tag mvs-g3, 2026-10-08, final build JOB 188): partial redraw (Write X'F1' + TPUT NOEDIT) and glyph animation with an idle
visual tick; options REDRAW(PARTIAL|FULL), ANIM(AUTO|YES|NO), METRICS(NO|YES). Final manual checklist PASS (AUTO, COLOR(YES) HILITE(YES),
ANIM(NO) REDRAW(FULL), COLOR(NO)). Design, results, known limitation: docs/G3-PARTIAL.md (D27, D28).
KNOWN LIMITATION (D28, investigation closed deliberately): in TK4-/MVS 3.8J + TSO + c3270, COLOR(AUTO) performs a capability Query Reply
that leaves the idle ticks held until the first AID; after the first input the animation works normally. COLOR(YES) HILITE(YES) skips the
query and the animation starts immediately (recommended on TK4-/c3270). Not a fault of the mechanics or of the G3 renderer.
Pending note (from G1, not G3 work): the ESTAE abend-restore exit in PACFSIO is implemented but not validated live.

1.0-MVS is the immutable functional baseline; z/OS out of scope.

MVS-G4 COMPLETE (tag mvs-g4, 2026-10-08, final build JOB 195): glyph profiles GLYPHS(AUTO|GRAPHIC|BASE|CLASSIC) (D29,
docs/G4-GLYPHS.md). Probe E9 (JOB 190) confirmed GE + CP310 APL, no loadable PS. GRAPHIC = CP310 pellets/sprites via GE, Pac-Man
facing left/right; BASE = base pellet; both draw walls as filled blocks (reverse video) with highlighting, `#` without; CLASSIC =
G3 byte for byte. The first centre-line wall tiles (JOB 191) were rejected live and replaced (docs/evidence/g4-wall-diagnosis.md,
historical). Live c3270 PASS (docs/evidence/g4-manual-c3270.md). Core frozen, PACFSIO unchanged. True arcade wall contours are
deferred to a future scaled renderer (preferably 2x2). Maintenance: `make_deck.py COMPRESS` if a build ends with SE37.
Regression to keep: tests/test_g4.py (oracle + 460 TSC streams + PACQRY + wall occupancy), tests/test_core_frozen.py.

NEXT (new session, NOT STARTED): MVS-G5 - Programmed Symbols experimental (master doc sec. 26). Note from E9: the c3270 Query
Reply announces no loadable symbol sets. Do not start without the user's go. Start by reading: CLAUDE.md, this file,
docs/DECISIONS.md (D22-D29), docs/G4-GLYPHS.md, docs/CAPABILITIES.md, docs/evidence/g4-probe-analysis.md. Probe lessons (G1-G4): check every
TPUT length (never `LA 0,n(0)`); any inbound (Query Reply too) locks the keyboard until a write with keyboard restore; verify on the
terminal side (c3270 -trace, tools/c3270_*.py) before concluding anything from visuals.
